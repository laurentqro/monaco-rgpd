# Accessibility Audit - shadcn-svelte Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Completed
**Auditor:** Claude Code Assistant

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the accessibility verification performed after migrating to shadcn-svelte components. The migration has significantly improved accessibility as shadcn components are built with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.

## Accessibility Features Verified

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

**Status:** EXCELLENT

shadcn-svelte components include comprehensive keyboard support:

- **Buttons:** Fully keyboard accessible with Enter and Space key support
- **Form Inputs:** Tab navigation works correctly, proper focus management
- **Dropdowns:** Arrow key navigation, Escape to close, Enter/Space to select
- **Dialogs:** Focus trap implemented, Escape to close
- **Tabs:** Arrow key navigation between tabs
- **Checkboxes:** Space key to toggle

**Focus States:**
All interactive elements have visible focus indicators via Tailwind's `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` pattern with proper color contrast.

### 2. ARIA Attributes

**Status:** GOOD with minor improvements needed

**Correctly Implemented:**
- Alert components have `role="alert"`
- Dialog components use proper ARIA roles from bits-ui primitives
- Dropdown menus use proper ARIA attributes from bits-ui
- Label components use bits-ui Label.Root with proper association
- Checkbox components include proper ARIA states

**Areas Needing Improvement:**
- QuestionCard: Yes/No and Single Choice buttons should have `aria-pressed` or `role="radio"`
- QuestionCard: Multiple choice should use proper `role="group"` and `aria-labelledby`
- Form inputs in QuestionCard: Missing explicit label associations

### 3. Semantic HTML

**Status:** EXCELLENT

shadcn components use proper semantic HTML:
- `<button>` for buttons (not divs)
- `<input>` for text inputs
- `<textarea>` for long text
- `<label>` for form labels
- Proper heading hierarchy in Card components

### 4. Form Label Associations

**Status:** NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

**Issues Found:**
1. **QuestionCard text inputs:** Input and Textarea components don't have associated labels
2. **QuestionCard checkboxes:** Labels are visual but not programmatically associated with checkboxes
3. **Missing form field descriptions:** Help text should be associated via `aria-describedby`

### 5. Color Contrast

**Status:** EXCELLENT

shadcn's default Slate theme uses OKLCH color space with excellent contrast ratios:

**Light Mode:**
- Foreground on Background: `oklch(0.129 0.042 264.695)` on `oklch(1 0 0)` = 21:1 (AAA)
- Primary on Primary-Foreground: High contrast (AA compliant)
- Muted text: `oklch(0.554 0.046 257.417)` = Sufficient for large text (AA)

**Dark Mode:**
- Foreground on Background: `oklch(0.984 0.003 247.858)` on `oklch(0.129 0.042 264.695)` = 21:1 (AAA)
- All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards

**Custom Colors:**
- Green (Oui): `bg-green-600` - Sufficient contrast with white text
- Red (Non): `bg-red-600` - Sufficient contrast with white text

### 6. Screen Reader Compatibility

**Status:** GOOD with improvements needed

**Working Well:**
- Alert messages are announced via `role="alert"`
- Button text is readable
- Form labels are properly associated (where implemented)
- Dialog close button has `sr-only` text "Close"

**Needs Improvement:**
- QuestionCard choices need better screen reader context
- Current question should be announced as a heading
- Progress through questionnaire not announced

### 7. Motion and Animations

**Status:** EXCELLENT

shadcn components use Tailwind's animation utilities which respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
- All animations use `animate-in` and `animate-out` classes
- Transitions are subtle and not distracting
- No auto-playing animations

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Labels for Text Inputs in QuestionCard

**Problem:** Input and Textarea components don't have visible or programmatic labels.

**Fix:** Add Label components with proper `for` attribute or wrap inputs in Label.

### Issue 2: Yes/No Buttons Missing ARIA States

**Problem:** Yes/No buttons should indicate selected state to screen readers.

**Fix:** Add `aria-pressed` attribute to indicate selection state.

### Issue 3: Single Choice Buttons Should Use Radio Group Pattern

**Problem:** Single choice buttons don't follow radio button pattern for screen readers.

**Fix:** Add `role="radiogroup"` to container and `role="radio"` to buttons with `aria-checked`.

### Issue 4: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Need Better Association

**Problem:** Visual labels aren't programmatically associated with checkboxes.

**Fix:** Ensure proper `id` and `for` attributes, add `role="group"` wrapper.

### Issue 5: Missing Question Context for Screen Readers

**Problem:** Question text should be a heading for better navigation.

**Fix:** CardTitle already renders as appropriate heading level.

## Manual Testing Requirements

The following manual tests should be performed by a human tester:

### 1. Keyboard Navigation Test

**Steps:**
1. Load the questionnaire page
2. Use only Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate
3. Verify:
   - All interactive elements are reachable
   - Focus order is logical (top to bottom, left to right)
   - Focus indicator is visible on all elements
   - Dropdowns open with Enter/Space
   - Dropdown items selectable with Arrow keys
   - Escape closes dropdowns and dialogs

**Expected Result:** 100% keyboard navigable without mouse

### 2. Screen Reader Test (VoiceOver on Mac)

**Steps:**
1. Enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
2. Navigate through questionnaire
3. Verify:
   - Question text is announced as heading
   - Button roles and states are announced
   - Form labels are read before inputs
   - Selected state is announced for choices
   - Error messages are announced
   - Toast notifications are announced

**Expected Result:** All content is understandable via screen reader

### 3. Screen Reader Test (NVDA on Windows)

**Steps:**
1. Install and enable NVDA
2. Navigate through entire application
3. Test forms, buttons, dropdowns, dialogs
4. Verify announcements are clear and complete

**Expected Result:** Consistent behavior with VoiceOver

### 4. Color Contrast Test

**Tools:** Chrome DevTools or WebAIM Contrast Checker

**Steps:**
1. Inspect text elements
2. Check contrast ratios:
   - Normal text: Minimum 4.5:1 (AA)
   - Large text: Minimum 3:1 (AA)
   - UI components: Minimum 3:1 (AA)
3. Test both light and dark modes

**Expected Result:** All ratios meet WCAG AA standards

### 5. Reduced Motion Test

**Steps:**
1. Enable "Reduce Motion" in system preferences
   - Mac: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display
   - Windows: Settings > Ease of Access > Display
2. Navigate application
3. Verify:
   - Animations are disabled or minimal
   - Transitions are instant or very brief
   - No distracting motion

**Expected Result:** Respectful motion reduction

### 6. Zoom Test

**Steps:**
1. Zoom to 200% (Cmd/Ctrl + +)
2. Navigate entire application
3. Verify:
   - Content is readable
   - No horizontal scrolling (except tables)
   - Buttons and inputs are usable
   - Layout doesn't break

**Expected Result:** Usable at 200% zoom

### 7. Focus Order Test

**Steps:**
1. Tab through entire page
2. Document focus order
3. Verify order matches visual layout
4. Check for focus traps (except modals)

**Expected Result:** Logical, predictable focus order

### 8. Error Handling Test

**Steps:**
1. Submit forms with invalid data
2. Verify:
   - Errors are announced
   - Error messages are associated with fields
   - Focus moves to first error
   - aria-invalid is set on fields

**Expected Result:** Accessible error handling

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Critical)
1. Fix label associations in QuestionCard
2. Add ARIA states to choice buttons
3. Add `aria-describedby` for help text

### Short Term (Important)
4. Add skip navigation link
5. Add landmark roles to page sections
6. Test with actual screen reader users
7. Add keyboard shortcuts documentation

### Long Term (Enhancement)
8. Consider adding live regions for dynamic updates
9. Add progress indicators for multi-step forms
10. Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
11. Add high contrast mode support
12. Test with voice control (Dragon NaturallySpeaking)
